Stack using Vectors in C++ 

This program allows you to check and manipulate a stack using vectors in C++. This allows for user inputs when you create the stack. This stack has the 
following features. 
- Push the integers on the Stack
- Pop the interger from the top of the stack
- Check the top of the stack
- Calculate the average of the values that are in the stack
- Display the stack 

# The following program requires no other files or input for implementation. All is data is added locaclly by the user. # 


The program performs the following functions in the proceeding order: 
- When the user compiles the program it will call and check to see if the stack is empty
- Then it will ask the user to input three numbers to push to the stack
- Once the user has input 3 numbers to the stack it will display the stack in its entireity
- Next it will pop the top of the stack off and display the stack once again
- Then it will find and print the top of the stack
- Finally the program will find and print the average of the integers that are found in the stack.
